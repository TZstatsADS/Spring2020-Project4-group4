+ Project summary: In this project, our group implement matrix factorization by focusing on different versions of alternating least squares algorithm for different Regularizations and Kernel Ridge Regression as Post-processing. The objective is to produce a good prediction of users’ preferences for movies on on the MovieLens dataset. For this project, our team is assigned with Pairing combination 12 + 14 from the Collaborative, which is showed below. For evaluation, we compared RMSE results for different methods. Our group used R language to product model and reports.
	+ Alternating Least Squares + Kernel Ridge Regression
	+ Alternating Least Squares + Penalty of magnitudes + Temporal Dynamics + Kernel Ridge Regression
